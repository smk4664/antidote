Welcome to Antidote
=======================

Antidote is a community initiative to democratize interactive,
dependency-free learning. It is the core of the `NRE Labs <https://labs.networkreliability.engineering>`_
project, which combines the Antidote platform with a specific :ref:`curriculum <contrib-curriculum>` built to teach
automation and Network Reliability Engineering principles. Together, NRE Labs
teaches skills right in your web browser with real tools, code and network devices.

Often the first step to learning about network automation is the hardest:
you need to setup complex virtual environments, labs, or worse risk
experimenting in production. Antidote makes this first step a lot easier, by simply
removing this initial barrier, and allowing the learner to focus only on the specific
topic in question, without sacrificing any of the useful interactivity of a dedicated lab.

Please refer to the table of contents above for the various parts of this documentation.
