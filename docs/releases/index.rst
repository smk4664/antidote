Release Planning
================

The NRE Labs project is composed of two high-level components, the Antidote platorm (a.k.a. "the platform")
and the NRE Labs Curriculum. These two parts of the project are managed separately, and you
should start with the relevant release planning document per the portion of the project you
wish to be involved with:

   releaseplanning_curriculum.rst
   releaseplanning_platform.rst

No matter where you want to get involved, the best place for updates our community forums and our weekly
project standups. Details for both can be found on the :ref:`community page <community>`.
