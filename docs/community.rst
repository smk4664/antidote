Community Resources
===================

We're truly interested in building a community around both the Antidote platform, as well as the NRE Labs curriculum.
To that end, we've created several resources for getting involved with the project, each aimed at a different use case
for community engagement.

.. _weekly-standups:

Weekly Standups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We hold weekly standups - open to all - every Tuesday at 8AM Pacific. Attending these are the best way
to start getting involved with the project, provide feedback, or ask a question.

All standups are recorded and `published to YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/c/NRELabs>`_
- usually within a day or two. Standup agendas are usually posted in advance to the
`Weekly Standup <https://community.networkreliability.engineering/c/weekly-standup>`_ forum topic. Meeting
minutes will be posted to the same topic after the meeting, with a link to the YouTube video.

The weekly standups are conducted over Zoom, and conference information can be found below:

.. _community-forums:

Community Forums
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The primary place for getting help with Antidote or NRE Labs is the `Community Forums <https://community.networkreliability.engineering>`_.
Use these if you need help with a problem, such as writing a lesson, or setting up a development environment. In general, if you have a question,
this is where you want to start.

There are a number of post categories available there, ranging from general discussion, to specifically getting help building lessons or
deploying Antidote. We'll also be posting news to the Announcements category from time-to-time, such as release plans, development cycles, etc.

We're currently using these forums primarily for technical conversations about the platform, but will be expanding our use of the platform greatly
in the coming months, as we have direct integrations between NRE Labs and the Community Forums planned this year.

Github
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Everything we produce in the Antidote project is on Github underneath the `nre-learning <https://github.com/nre-learning>`_
organization. Underneath that organization, you'll find all kinds of repositories, including the platform software,
operational tooling, blogs, and more. Use this to communicate with project members to file a bug or feature request, or otherwise participate
in the code side of the project.

While there is no single repository that hosts everything, the canonically "main" repository is probably the
`Antidote repo <https://github.com/nre-learning/antidote>`_. Most subcomponents of the Antidote project
are hosted in their own dedicated repositories, but this will be a good starting point, as the README
does contain references to other repositories you may also want to know about.

Finally, all project planning related to the Antidote platform, such as for subcomponents like ``syringe``
and ``antidote-web`` are done in `Github projects <https://github.com/orgs/nre-learning/projects>`_. Generally
while we're working on a release, we'll open up a new project for that release, and all current status for that
release can be found within that project. So, if you're looking for a status on current development efforts,
this is where you want to go.

Discord Channel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We use Discord for chat and audio/video collaboration. You can think of it like Slack, but even better, because it's
more purpose-built for some of things we want to do in the future with NRE Labs, and the authentication story is a
bit better. :)

In general, use this for more informal, real-time communication with project maintainers and members, especially during events
or livestreams.

Join our Discord channel via `this link <https://discord.gg/fRuSUyD>`_.

Twitter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Follow `@NRELabs <https://twitter.com/nrelabs>`_ on twitter for periodic updates on NRE Labs and the underlying platform.

Weekly Livestreams and Other Videos
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We run a weekly livestream on Twitch at 10AM Pacific Time. Right now this is fairly informal - some weeks we might dive
deep into a topic, other weeks we might just casually chat about what's next on the project plan.

Check out our `Twitch channel <https://twitch.tv/nrelabs>`_ to watch live, and interact with us in the chat. Ask questions or
provide feedback to us live, and we might talk about it on stream!

If you can't join live, check out our `YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/c/NRELabs>`_, where we post the
recordings for all our streams, as well as all other video content.

Blog
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The `Network Reliability Engineering blog <https://networkreliability.engineering/post/>`_ is where we like to write about NRE concepts
and any big changes to NRE Labs. You may also be interested to know that this blog is powered by Hugo, and
`maintained in Github <https://github.com/nre-learning/nre-blog>`_, so if you want to write a guest post by opening a pull request
to that repo, we'd love to have you!
